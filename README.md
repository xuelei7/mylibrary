# My Library

## Introduction
I will add the editorial to [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) Problems.
These editorials are wroten by me (xuelei). There might be some mistakes in it.
Please contact me if you find some place wrong, and I **might** fix it.

Also I want to give links to the algorithms used in the problems, write the algorithms into templates (wroten in c++)
and categorize them. **IN THE FUTURE**

- 2020/11/15 started putting AOJ (Aizu Online Judge) codes here
- 2020/11/15 started making function libraries

â€»Please Notice: The aim for me to make this library is **ONLY** to tidy up knowledges and codes of my own.
