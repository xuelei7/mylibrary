// Problem I. Sum of QQ
// You received a card with an integer S and a multiplication table of infinite size. All the elements in the table are integers, and an integer at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is Ai,j=i×j (i,j≥1). The table has infinite size, i.e., the number of the rows and the number of the columns are infinite.

// You love rectangular regions of the table in which the sum of numbers is S. Your task is to count the number of integer tuples (a,b,c,d) that satisfies 1≤a≤b,1≤c≤d and ∑bi=a∑dj=cAi,j=S.

// Input
// The input consists of a single test case of the following form.

// S  
// The first line consists of one integer S (1≤S≤105), representing the summation of rectangular regions you have to find.

// Output
// Print the number of rectangular regions whose summation is S in one line.
