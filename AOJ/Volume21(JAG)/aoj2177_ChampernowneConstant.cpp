// Problem C:Champernowne Constant
// Champernown constant is an irrational number represented in decimal by "0." followed by concatenation of all positive integers in the increasing order. The first few digits of this constant are: 0.123456789101112...

// Your task is to write a program that outputs the K digits of Chapnernown constant starting at the N-th place for given two natural numbers K and N.

// Input
// The input has multiple lines. Each line has two positive integers N and K (N ≤ 109, K ≤ 100) separated by a space.

// The end of input is indicated by a line with two zeros. This line should not be processed.

// Output
// For each line, output a line that contains the K digits.
