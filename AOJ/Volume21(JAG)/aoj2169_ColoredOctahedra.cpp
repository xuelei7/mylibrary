// Problem E: Colored Octahedra
// A young boy John is playing with eight triangular panels. These panels are all regular triangles of the same size, each painted in a single color; John is forming various octahedra with them.

// While he enjoys his playing, his father is wondering how many octahedra can be made of these panels since he is a pseudo-mathematician. Your task is to help his father: write a program that reports the number of possible octahedra for given panels. Here, a pair of octahedra should be considered identical when they have the same combination of the colors allowing rotation.

// Input
// The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset has the following format:

// Color1 Color2 ... Color8

// Each Colori (1 ≤ i ≤ 8) is a string of up to 20 lowercase alphabets and represents the color of the i-th triangular panel.

// The input ends with EOF.

// Output
// For each dataset, output the number of different octahedra that can be made of given panels.
