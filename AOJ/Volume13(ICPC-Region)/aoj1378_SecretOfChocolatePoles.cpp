// Problem A Secret of Chocolate Poles
// Wendy, the master of a chocolate shop, is thinking of displaying poles of chocolate disks in the showcase. She can use three kinds of chocolate disks: white thin disks, dark thin disks, and dark thick disks. The thin disks are 1 cm thick, and the thick disks are k cm thick. Disks will be piled in glass cylinders.

// Each pole should satisfy the following conditions for her secret mission, which we cannot tell.

// A pole should consist of at least one disk.
// The total thickness of disks in a pole should be less than or equal to l cm.
// The top disk and the bottom disk of a pole should be dark.
// A disk directly upon a white disk should be dark and vice versa.
// As examples, six side views of poles are drawn in Figure A.1. These are the only possible side views she can make when l=5 and k=3.


// Figure A.1. Six chocolate poles corresponding to Sample Input 1

// Your task is to count the number of distinct side views she can make for given l and k to help her accomplish her secret mission.

// Input
// The input consists of a single test case in the following format.

// l k
// Here, the maximum possible total thickness of disks in a pole is l cm, and the thickness of the thick disks is k cm. l and k are integers satisfying 1≤l≤100 and 2≤k≤10.

// Output
// Output the number of possible distinct patterns.
