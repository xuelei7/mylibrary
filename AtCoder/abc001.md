### Problem Summary
We have a number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" />. According the rules below, output the two digit new number with leading zero.

Notice that the unit of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" /> is meter. You have to change the unit to kilometer first.

1. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" /> < 0.1km : 00
2. 0.1km ≦ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" /> ≦ 5km : <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10&space;\times&space;m" />
3. 6km ≦ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" /> ≦ 30km : <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m&plus;50" />
4. 35km ≦ <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" /> ≦ 70km : <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(m-30)\div5&plus;80" />
5. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" /> ≦ 70km : 89

### Constraints
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0\leqslant&space;m\leqslant&space;100,000" />

### Problem Summary
The degree(multipled by 10) and distance(meter per minute) is given. According to the table, output the new degree and distance.

#### degree to direction
- greater than 11.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 33.75 (exclusive) ⇒ NNE
- greater than 33.75 (inclusive) ~ less than 56.25 (exclusive) ⇒ NE
- greater than 56.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 78.75 (exclusive) ⇒ ENE
- greater than 78.75 (inclusive) ~ less than 101.25 (exclusive) ⇒ E
- greater than 101.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 123.75 (exclusive) ⇒ ESE
- greater than 123.75 (inclusive) ~ less than 146.25 (exclusive) ⇒ SE
- greater than 146.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 168.75 (exclusive) ⇒ SSE
- greater than 168.75 (inclusive) ~ less than 191.25 (exclusive) ⇒ S
- greater than 191.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 213.75 (exclusive) ⇒ SSW
- greater than 213.75 (inclusive) ~ less than 236.25 (exclusive) ⇒ SW
- greater than 236.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 258.75 (exclusive) ⇒ WSW
- greater than 258.75 (inclusive) ~ less than 281.25 (exclusive) ⇒ W
- greater than 281.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 303.75 (exclusive) ⇒ WNW
- greater than 303.75 (inclusive) ~ less than 326.25 (exclusive) ⇒ NW
- greater than 326.25 (inclusive) ~ less than 348.75 (exclusive) ⇒ NNW
- other ⇒ N

#### distance to strength
- greater than 0.0m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 0.2m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 0 **!!when strength is 0 you have to print out "C 0"**
- greater than 0.3m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 1.5m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 1
- greater than 1.6m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 3.3m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 2
- greater than 3.4m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 5.4m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 3
- greater than 5.5m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 7.9m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 4
- greater than 8.0m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 10.7m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 5
- greater than 10.8m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 13.8m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 6
- greater than 13.9m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 17.1m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 7
- greater than 17.2m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 20.7m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 8
- greater than 20.8m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 24.4m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 9
- greater than 24.5m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 28.4m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 10
- greater than 28.5m/s (inclusive) ~ less than 32.6m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 11
- greater than 32.7m/s (inclusive) ⇒ 12

#### Notice
Since second place after the decimal point of distance needs to be rounded off, you have to be careful to the error.

### Constraints
0≦Deg<3,600

0≦Dis<12,000

### Solution
**Method 1**: do what is required
